# Name and Tagline
Startupify - A online admin system for startups

# Real world application
## Off the shelf or Custom?
Normally web apps are made custom for a client. This webapp is more able to serve as an off the shelf product. This is due to the nature of its database. Where most webapps use a relational database this uses a type of flat file database.
## Flexibility or Advance operations?
This variant of flat file database is valuable because it is user friendly enough that you can structure the data yourself without a developer. This is due to the fact that this variant of flat file database is very flexible. Relational databases are much more rigid. Flexibility has a disadvantage though as more rigid databases are able to have much more advanced operations performed on them. An example of an advance operation is automatically counting the quantity of products in stock between branches in a franchise.
## Perfect match
But itâ€™s ok because these advanced operations are often not required in startups. So this setup is perfect for beginner admin systems. On a side note in the initial phase of an administrative systems development it can really benefit from having flexibility.
## Type of data
This system can facilitate normal business data. Both internal and external communication/data. Internal communication like accounting documents and external communication like marketing material.
